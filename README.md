# ClipBoard Speaker
ClipBoard Speaker is an application developed using C# and the .Net Framework. The ClipBoard Speaker allows you to have a speech synthesizer read text out loud to you from the clipboard. This allows you to read text from any program whether it be a PDF, Office doc, or email with one single application. While this is a simple application it solves some of the issues with other text to speech applications that are available out there. There are some TTS(Text to Speech) applications that allow you to use extensions in the browser. There are some that work only in a program like PDFâ€™s but with ClipBoard Speaker you have access to any area of your personal computer.


<h1>Directions:</h1> 
       Download the ClipBoard Speaker Application. Simply copy any text to the clipboard and press the F8 key to have it read out loud. Accessing the application notification area of the taskbar and right-clicking on its icon will give access to settings for customizing the application. In order to stop ClipBoard Speaker from running on your computer, you can simply install it with add/remove programs in the control panel.
