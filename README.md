# ClipBoard Speaker
TextToSpeech is an application developed using C# and the .Net Framework. The ClipBoard Speaker allows you to have a speech synthesizer read text out loud to you from the clipboard. This allows you to read text from any program whether it be a PDF, Office doc, or email with one single application. While this is a simple application it solves some of the issues with other text to speech applications that are available out there. There are some TTS(Text to Speech) applications that allow you to use extensions in the browser. There are some that work only in a program like PDFâ€™s but with ClipBoard Speaker you have access to any area of your personal computer.


<h1>Directions:</h1> 
       Download the ClipBoard Speaker Application. Just copy the text and click the app icon in the taskbar notification area. The text will start reading as soon as you click the icon or press F8. The app will take anything that is in the clipboard and say it out loud so that you don't have to read it.
