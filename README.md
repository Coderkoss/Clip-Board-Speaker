# ClipBoard Speaker
ClipBoard Speaker is an application developed using C# and the .Net Framework.
The ClipBoard Speaker allows you to have a speech synthesizer read text out loud to you from the clipboard. This
allows you to read text from any program whether it be a PDF, Office doc, or email with one single application. 
While this is a simple application it solves some of the issues with other text to speech applications that are available 
out there. There are some TTS(Text to Speech) applications that allow you to use extensions in the browser. 
There are some that work only in a program like PDF’s but with ClipBoard Speaker you have access to any area of your 
personal computer.
